# Checkpoint-Project---School-Management-System

I have learned the basics of CSS, JS and HTML and now it's time to apply my skills in a real project. My task is to develop a **learning management system** application that will reinforce the acquired knowledge of CSS, JS and HTML.

## Plan

1. Interface development
   - [ ] Create a Home page

2. Add Interactivity with JavaScript
3. Optimization for Mobile Devices

## Technical Limitations:

- No SPA frameworks like Angular or React.
- **BUT** I can use CSS frameworks, like Boostrap
